In this project, I am analyzing time series data related to global daily COVID-19 deaths from 2020. I begin by importing the necessary packages for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling, including libraries like pmdarima, statsmodels, and sklearn. After loading the dataset, I extract daily death counts starting from January 22, 2020, and reformat the data into a usable time series structure with dates as the index.

Next, I visualize the cumulative death counts over time and examine the daily increase by computing the difference between consecutive days. I then split the dataset into training and testing sets, using data before July 30, 2020, for training and the remaining data for testing. To model the data, I create a SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors) model, fitting it to the training set to capture the patterns in the time series and forecast future deaths.

Once the model is trained, I generate predictions for the testing period (July 30 to August 13, 2020) and plot these predictions alongside the actual observations to visually assess the model's performance. Finally, I calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to quantify the accuracy of the SARIMAX model, comparing the predictions to the actual test data to evaluate how well the model performs.

The potential value of this project lies in its ability to provide insights into the trajectory of COVID-19 deaths, aiding public health officials and policymakers in making informed decisions. Accurately forecasting future death counts can help in resource allocation, planning for healthcare capacity, and developing strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.
